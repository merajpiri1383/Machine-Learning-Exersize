# Machine Learning on UCI Datasets  

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks where I apply different **machine learning algorithms** on datasets from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/).  
The goal of this project is to practice data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison across different datasets.  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure  

- `notebooks/` â€“ Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) for each dataset and algorithm experiment  

---

## ðŸ“Š Datasets Used  

Some of the UCI datasets explored in this repository include:  

- [Nursery](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/76/nursery.zip)   

*(More will be added as I continue experimenting.)*

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Algorithms Applied  

Across the datasets, I experiment with:  

- **Supervised Learning**  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Trees & Random Forests  
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)  
  - Gradient Boosting  

- **Unsupervised Learning**  
  - k-Means Clustering  
  - PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)  

- **Model Evaluation**  
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
  - Confusion Matrix & ROC Curves
